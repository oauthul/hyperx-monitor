# HXCSBatteryMon
A lightweight battery monitor application for the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 Wireless, built in Rust for Linux.

## Why?
I recently switched to Linux from Windows and there was no native HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 Wireless battery monitoring application, so I decided to make it myself, and to learn Rust.
